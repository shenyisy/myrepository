Rate cuts have the “potential to unlock capital at all stages,” says David Spreng of Runway Growth Capital.','Venture capitalists applauded the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by a half percentage point, saying the move was a long-awaited step toward kick-starting a slumping venture industry. Investors said the cut on Wednesday isn’t likely to have an immediate effect on the venture market, but that over months lower interest rates could improve access to capital for startups and spur more initial public offerings, a key way investors cash out of startups. The IPO market has been in the doldrums for the better part of two years.'),(2,'2024-09-11','https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-firm-fika-pulls-in-160-million-to-invest-in-ai-startups-0494a931','The Fika Ventures team, seen above. Co-founder TX Zhuo, fourth from right, says ‘We wouldn’t invest in a company without an AI strategy because we think that’s very important in today’s world.’','Fika Ventures has raised a $160 million fourth fund as investors continue seeking exposure to artificial intelligence, the cornerstone technology for the venture firm’s portfolio companies. Los Angeles-based Fika will make investments in sectors including fintech, supply chain and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare and enterprise software. Co-founder TX Zhuo said the companies the firm backs seize on the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, including generative AI. '),(3,'2024-07-15','https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-synapse-bankruptcy-has-the-fintech-world-on-edge-f83cbe6d','Synapse, which served as a middleman between fintech startups and licensed banks, filed for bankruptcy in April.','For months now, thousands of consumers have been unable to access money they thought was safely deposited at banks.  They are victims of the bankruptcy of a little-known venture-backed startup called Synapse Financial Technologies, whose shutdown is harming not only consumers but also fintech startups that worked with it, as well as the broader fintech sector. '),(4,'2024-05-20','https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-venture-firm-new-form-aims-to-raise-100-million-fund-eb03c940','A rebound in bitcoin, a key underlying asset in the crypto sector, has propelled investor enthusiasm this year for crypto startups.','Crypto and blockchain-focused venture firm New Form Capital is returning to the fundraising market, seeking to raise a $100 million fund in the latest sign investors remain bullish on the once-beleaguered crypto sector. New Form says it backs crypto-related technology that aims to reshape traditional finance, including trading markets and payments systems.

The typical pace of capital deployment means many of the firms behind those funds are now back in the market. They are entering a very different fundraising arena where limited partners, which invest in venture funds, are making more demands before agreeing to invest. Boston and New York-based 186 Ventures is one such firm. After launching in 2021 with a $37 million pre-seed and seed-focused fund, 186 Ventures is setting out to raise again, targeting a $50 million vehicle to target startup sectors including artificial intelligence and financial technology. LPs are playing a tougher game, co-founder and Managing Partner Giuseppe Stuto said in an interview with WSJ Pro Venture Capital. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. '),(6,'2024-02-12','https://www.wsj.com/articles/stalled-ipo-market-leaves-startup-employees-individuals-eager-to-unload-shares-b53b0c41','Rising demand in the secondary market is proving to be a tailwind for a crop of venture-backed startups that help facilitate sales. ','When the market for initial public offerings was booming in 2021 companies were eager to list shares and give equity holders the chance to cash out.  Then the public market soured and the IPO window shut.

He has no junior investors, analysts, admin people—no employees at all. At the end of last year, Palo Alto, Calif.-based Uncorrelated closed a $315 million fund, overshooting its $225 million target. Added to previous capital raised, the new haul turned Deshpande into one of the rare venture capitalists to manage that much money on his own.'),(8,'2024-01-02','https://www.wsj.com/articles/lps-doubt-venture-funds-startup-valuations-598e31d0','‘It’s very hard to hear that all these companies are going to go out of business,’ said Beezer Clarkson, partner at Sapphire Partners.','What are venture fund portfolios worth now? There is little agreement on that question today, an issue that is slowing down an already sedate venture fundraising market.  Once all the data is tallied, 2023 is expected to be the worst year for venture fundraising globally since 2015, according to both research firms Preqin and PitchBook Data.'),(9,'2023-12-06','https://www.wsj.com/articles/vast-datas-ceo-discusses-fundraising-future-plans-533b9f5c','Nvidia is a backer of Vast Data, which last month raised $118 million in a Series E round.','Data infrastructure company Vast Data is now valued at $9.1 billion—more than double its worth two years ago. In addition, the firm’s revenue has doubled in the last year, said CEO and Co-founder Renen Hallak, who expects that “exponential trajectory” to continue. At end-November, the New York-based company raised $118 million in a Series E financing round led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, with participation by venture firms New Enterprise Associates, Bond and Drive Capital. The private company has raised $381 million to date, with shareholders including Nvidia, Goldman Sachs and General Atlantic.

Nascent startups must clear a higher bar for metrics like annual recurring revenue and customer acquisition to attract investors, who also say they are reviewing more deals before committing. '),(11,'2023-08-30','https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-are-hitting-a-funding-wall-after-seed-stage-16b81af6','Startups Are Hitting a Funding Wall After Seed Stage','When the startup market began souring last year, many investors shifted to small-dollar bets on ventures in their earliest stages. Now, an entrenched downturn has more of these startups unable or unwilling to raise follow-up Series A rounds. “The graduation rate to Series A is way below historical norms,” said Avlok Kohli, chief executive of AngelList, an online network of startups and investors. “There’s just not that many people writing those bigger checks.”'),(12,'2023-08-21','https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-venture-investing-arms-wrestle-with-sagging-values-sell-assets-bbf38132','Total’s TotalEnergies Ventures unit in June sold 20 minority stakes in startups to Aster Capital Partners.','Companies with in-house venture-capital arms such as French energy company Total are retrenching by selling assets after collapsing startup values led them to rethink how to invest. In June, for instance, Total’s climate-focused TotalEnergies Ventures sold 20 minority stakes in startups to venture investment manager Aster Capital Partners. The sale came a year after Total shut its venture business and replaced it with a startup accelerator. Total didn’t respond to a request for comment on the action, but in announcing the asset sale, Aster partner Fabio Lancellotti suggested economic conditions and the cyclicality of venture capital is prompting companies to sell assets and “reposition themselves” toward core businesses.'),(13,'2023-07-24','https://www.wsj.com/articles/pro-take-insider-rounds-could-hurt-returns-for-venture-investors-84d80b57','One example of an insider deal that worked is WhatsApp, a company where Sequoia Capital was the only venture investor. Facebook acquired WhatsApp for about $19 billion in 2014.','Startup founders are increasingly getting money from their existing investors via financing known as an insider round. Research says that for investors, such rounds are often throwing good money after bad, with notable exceptions. The volume of funding rounds led by an existing investor jumped to about a third of all venture dollars invested so far this year in the U.S., the highest share since at least 2010 on an annualized basis, according to PitchBook Data. By count, such deals represented about 10% of the total this year through July 18, similarly setting a decadelong record, per the data provider. '),(14,'2023-07-07','https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-stocks-have-recovered-but-that-hasnt-helped-startups-c925428c','The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 30% in 2022, but is up 32% so far this year. Startup funding continues to dwindle.','Renewed vitality among large technology firms has yet to re-energize tech startups and their investors, who in recent months continued to put funding deals on hold and push back public-market debuts, according to the latest market data.  Over the past year, venture-capital investors, company founders and analysts said the prolonged slump across the startup world would start to ease once public tech companies regained their footing, putting behind the market declines, budget cuts and layoffs of 2022.    '),(15,'2023-05-17','https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurtech-unicorn-bolttech-raises-196-million-nudging-up-valuation-cf85b1e1','Bolttech, which was founded in 2020, is based in Singapore.','Bolttech, a three-year-old insurance exchange, has notched a valuation of $1.6 billion after adding more investors to its latest funding round. The Singapore-based insurance-technology company on Wednesday said it has raised $196 million in an expanded Series B round led by Japanese insurer Tokio Marine. That sum includes $50 million that the property-and-casualty insurer had invested in the same round in October 2022, a spokesman for Bolttech said.'),(16,'2023-04-05','https://www.wsj.com/articles/everywhere-ventures-bucks-trend-by-investing-globally-1071ca09','Jenny Fielding and Scott Hartley, managing partners of Everywhere Ventures.','Jenny Fielding and Scott Hartley, managing partners of Everywhere Ventures, are pursuing a domestic and international investment strategy as U.S. venture capitalists have taken a step back from deals abroad. The managers of Everywhere Ventures, formerly called The Fund, say they have found an efficient way for a two-person team to invest a small fund in geographically diverse early-stage startups. The firm uses technology to activate hundreds of individual limited partners and connect them with portfolio company founders globally. Its local networks help the managers source and vet deals, while keeping the firm’s operating expenses low.

Artificial-intelligence startup Artifact has hit a wall trying to secure credit from several large banks, said co-founder and Chief Executive Nate Sanders. The Salt Lake City startup began looking for alternatives for its multimillion-dollar venture-debt facility with SVB when the bank collapsed earlier this month, turning first to big banks, he said.
